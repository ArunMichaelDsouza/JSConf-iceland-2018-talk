## Title of the talk
Houdini - What lies ahead.

This talk aims at covering the CSS Houdini spec and its amalgamation with JavaScript.

This talk will focus on current ideas (being discussed by the CSS Houdini working group), finalised specifications, future plans for development of CSS Houdini and how it will change the way we use JavaScript APIs to create rich user experiences.
